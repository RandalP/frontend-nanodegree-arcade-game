The aim of the game is use the cursor keys to cross from the grass to the water, while avoiding collisions with the bugs. When all lives are lost, the game is over. After every 10 successful crossings, you get a new life, but you will need it because the bugs speed up with every successful crossing!

While you're on the grass, you can change the player's image by pressing space bar to cycle through the available images.

The high score and last selected player image are saved at the end of the game.
